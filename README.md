## Project Breakdown

### Setup and Cloning

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the GitHub repo containing the project template.
2. **Clone Repository**: Clone the repository in the Cloud IDE environment.

### Static Pages

1. Create static pages to fulfill user stories.

### Local Setup

1. **Run Locally**: Run the application locally.
2. **User Management**: Add user management to the Python-based Web Framework application.

### Backend Services

1. **Node.js Server**: Create a Node.js server to manage dealers and reviews using MongoDB and Dockerize it.
2. **Deploy Sentiment Analyzer**: Deploy sentiment analyzer on Code Engine.
3. **Python-based Web Framework Models and Views**: Create Python-based Web Framework models and views to manage car models and car makes.
4. **Proxy Services**: Create Python-based Web Framework proxy services and views to integrate dealers and reviews.

### Dynamic Pages

1. **Dealers Page**: Create a page that displays all the dealers.
2. **Reviews Page**: Create a page that displays reviews for a selected dealer.
3. **Add Review Page**: Create a page that lets the end user add a review for a selected dealer.

### CI/CD and Testing

1. **CI/CD Setup**: Set up continuous integration and delivery for code linting.
2. **Run and Test**: Run the application on Cloud IDE and test it locally.
3. **Deployment**: Deploy the application on Kubernetes.

## Solution Architecture

### Technologies Used

- **Django**: Python-based Web application framework
- **Node.js**: Backend server for managing dealers and reviews
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing dealer and review data
- **Docker**: Containerization for Node.js server
- **IBM Cloud Code Engine**: Deployment platform for sentiment analyzer
- **SQLite**: Database for storing car make and model data

### Services

#### Dealerships Website (Python-based Web Framework Application)

- **Microservices**:
  - `get_cars/`: Get list of cars
  - `get_dealers/`: Get list of dealers
  - `get_dealers/:state`: Get dealers by state
  - `dealer/:id`: Get dealer by ID
  - `review/dealer/:id`: Get reviews for a dealer
  - `add_review/`: Post review about a dealer

- **Database**: SQLite for Car Make and Car Model data

#### Dealerships and Reviews Service (Express Mongo Service)

- **Services**:
  - `/fetchDealers`: Fetch the dealers
  - `/fetchDealer/:id`: Fetch the dealer by ID
  - `/fetchReviews`: Fetch all reviews
  - `/fetchReview/dealer/:id`: Fetch reviews for a dealer by ID
  - `/insertReview`: Insert a review

#### Sentiment Analyzer Service (IBM Cloud Code Engine)

- **Service**:
  - `/analyze/:text`: Analyze the sentiment of the text (returns positive, negative, or neutral)

**Interaction**:
- **Python-based Web Framework Proxy Service**: Interacts with "Dealerships and Reviews Service" and "Sentiment Analyzer Service" to provide combined functionality within the Python-based Web Framework application.

## Configuration Steps

### Python-based Web Framework Environment Setup

1. **Navigate to Server Directory**:
   ```sh
   cd /home/project/xrwvm-fullstack_developer_capstone/server


## Configuration

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/nattalliit/xrwvm-ibm-fullstack_developer_capstone.git
cd /home/project/xrwvm-ibm-fullstack_developer_capstone/server
```
### 2. Run the following to set up the Python-based Web Framework environment
```sh
pip install django
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv djangoenv
source djangoenv/bin/activate
```
### 3. Install the required packages by running the following command
```sh
python3 -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Run the following command to perform model migration
```sh
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py runserver
```
### 5. Open a new terminal and build the front end as before
```sh
cd /home/project/xrwvm-fullstack_developer_capstone/server/frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

### 6. Add host data to server/djangoproj/settings.py
```sh
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost','https://nrudnikova-8000.theianext-1-labs-prod-misc-tools-us-east-0.proxy.cognitiveclass.ai']
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = ['https://nrudnikova-8000.theianext-1-labs-prod-misc-tools-us-east-0.proxy.cognitiveclass.ai']
